                </div>
                <p>  When people think about a beautiful tree lined trail,they don’t usually picture the city. Here in Philly, we have the best of both worlds. Running along the edge of the Schuylkill River and Lincoln Drive is the Schuylkill River Trail. This trail is the source of enjoyment, exercise, and commute for thousands of Philadelphians.

          The trail is about 10 miles in length, making for a great cycling route. It provides the residents of the city a place for fun and exercise with lush scenery. The section of the trail between the Schuylkill Banks and East Falls is completely paved. It’s perfect for walking, running, and cycling. Part of the trail runs along Kelly Drive and takes you right past one of the most well known spots in the city, Boathouse Row.

          Past East Falls, the trail is a sidewalk that leads Ridge Avenue and then continues onto Main Street in the trendy town of Manayunk. Then trail then leads behind Main Street along Manayunk Canal towpath and so on. Traveling the opposite direction into the city, the trail runs right under the Market, Chestnut, and Walnut Street bridges. It’s a magnificent sight at night. Once the trail hits Locust Street, though, there isn’t enough room for a trail because the railroad tracksare too close to the river. Alas, the trail keeps growing! Luckily, the City of Philadelphia came to the rescue with this awesome idea… A boardwalk over the river!

          The “boardwalk” is a 2,000-foot long concrete structure that runs along the east shore of the Schuylkill from Locust Street to the newly built South Street stairtower. The boardwalk is around 15 feet wide, so it can be a little crowded, so the city has provided 4 widened areas to relax and enjoy the views. This new extension of the trail is believed to be a transformative experience. You will be able to actually get off of land and be surrounded by the water. It is a truly freeing experience. Being out over the water gives you a very zen feel. The trail has gotten great reviews thus far, but you’ll have to get out there to experience it yourself!

          This trail is very near and dear to my heart. It is yet another space for relaxation and collection of thoughts away from the hassle of the city. Running along this trail will simply make you smile. Between the beautiful scenery and the peaceful atmosphere, you will be coming back for more. It is a truly excellent trail and I recommend everyone living in the Philly area make a visit here as soon as possible. You will not regret it!

          All ages are welcomed to the trail, where you will see everyone from hardcore (pretentious) cyclists to the amateur (out of shape) joggers. People on the trail are mostly nice and courteous. Taking a stroll along this trail will give you the time we all need to ponder our thoughts and find ourselves again. I am a firm believer in natural mental healing. The Schuylkill River Trail is one of my favorite things in Philadelphia and it just might become yours too.</p>

                  <h3 class="text-center blue-heading">Rittenhouse Square</h3>
                </div>
                <p>Rittenhouse Square is the epitome of perfect cityscapes in Philadelphia. Embellished with trendy inhabitants of Center City, this haven is surrounded by elegant restaurants and shops along with high-rise luxury apartments. This sanctuary is a great place to bring a significant other on a day out in the city. Some of my favorite restaurants in the square are Barclay Prime, Parc, and Rouge. Enjoy a tasteful dinner at Barclay Prime or stop by Parc for a Parisian brunch. Rouge offers a trendy and delicious dining experience in an intimate space.

I often walked through the park on fall afternoons when I was looking for somewhere to simply get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Sit on one of the benches and take in the beauty of the lush trees and architecture. Take a break and lay in the grass. This park is all about relaxation and delight. One can often find a performer playing guitar or other various instruments. I have encountered dancers and jugglers. Undoubtedly, Rittenhouse Square is the place to be to meet sophisticated urbanites.

Along the surrounding streets you will find a plethora of boutiques and shops. Shopping is definitely one of the main attractions in the area. The park runs along Walnut Street where you will find people hunting for the most up to date and stylish clothing. I will delve into the specifics of some of my favorite stores in a later blog. One of the biggest and most popular stores in Rittenhouse Square is Barnes and Nobles. This generational bookstore is the perfect place for one of the more studious college students in the area looking for that darn book that’s required for their English class. Make book shopping a little less painful by grabbing a latte from Joe, a popular coffee shop also located in the square.

Pick up whatever your heart desires in the square and take a stroll back through the center of the park one last time before leaving. Soak up the natural energy of the green space and return to the concrete jungle feeling just a little less robotic.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-center blue-heading">Philly Cheesesteaks</h3>
                  </div>
              <p> There comes a time…in every Philadelphian’s life…when he or she must decide on where to get a cheesecake. I know, I know. Some of you may be thinking, Why does it matter where you go, a cheesesteak is a cheesesteak?  See…that is far from the truth here in the City of Brotherly Love. Philadelphia is famous for cheesesteaks. Aye, it’s our thing, OK? Naturally, when a city is known for something, restaurants start competing to be the best in the city. This is all too real in Philly.

You’ve got Pat’s, Geno’s, Jim’s, Tony Luke’s, and Delessandro’s…and that’s only the popular ones that I can think of off the top of my head. There are many, many places in the city that specialize in cheesesteaks. Usually, one has to try a few just to find out which one they prefer. And generally, once you find your steak shop, you are loyal to that place. People will drive for miles to get their favorite steak. I know people that will drive from as much as an hour outside the city just to get their hands (or rather mouths) on one. We love our cheesesteaks.

So now that you made it to the cheesesteak place, you’re hungry, but now you’re confused. Why does the man taking my order seem so impatient and angry at me, I’m just trying to figure out what I want?! Listen here; there is a method to ordering a cheesesteak here in Philly. You can’t just stand there and stare at the menu board when the guy is asking for your order. There’s a huge line behind you that you may or may not have waited in for quite awhile if you’re at a popular spot. Get it together, now.

To order a cheesesteak in Philly, you ask for with your choice of cheese and then with or without onions. But you don’t just say it like that. You order a cheesecake with cheese whiz and with onions, you ask for “one whiz with.” Trust me, every cheesesteak shop worker knows what this means. If you wanted two cheesesteaks with American cheese and no onions, you would say “two American without.” It’s that simple. (Ugh, now I’m craving a cheesesteak)

Okay, so let’s get into it. One of my favorite places, located at 39 E. Oregon Avenue, near and underpass on I-95 in South Philly, you’ll find Tony Luke’s. Here, you literally order your cheesecake on the street. There’s no time for an inside. At Tony Luke’s, you might be given a hard time by the workers. Act natural, this is normal and it’s a characteristic they take pride in, really. Orders are taken through a window and you can eat at one of the outdoor picnic tables. It’s all part of the experience. Take the time to grab one before heading over to a game at the close by sport complex. They are seriously something worth trying.

Cheesesteaks are Philly’s featured food of choice. What are you waiting for? Go get yours now!</p>
