        When people think about a beautiful tree lined trail,they don’t usually picture the city. Here in Philly, we have the best of both worlds. Running along the edge of the Schuylkill River and Lincoln Drive is the Schuylkill River Trail. This trail is the source of enjoyment, exercise, and commute for thousands of Philadelphians.

The trail is about 10 miles in length, making for a great cycling route. It provides the residents of the city a place for fun and exercise with lush scenery. The section of the trail between the Schuylkill Banks and East Falls is completely paved. It’s perfect for walking, running, and cycling. Part of the trail runs along Kelly Drive and takes you right past one of the most well known spots in the city, Boathouse Row.

Past East Falls, the trail is a sidewalk that leads Ridge Avenue and then continues onto Main Street in the trendy town of Manayunk. Then trail then leads behind Main Street along Manayunk Canal towpath and so on. Traveling the opposite direction into the city, the trail runs right under the Market, Chestnut, and Walnut Street bridges. It’s a magnificent sight at night. Once the trail hits Locust Street, though, there isn’t enough room for a trail because the railroad tracksare too close to the river. Alas, the trail keeps growing! Luckily, the City of Philadelphia came to the rescue with this awesome idea… A boardwalk over the river!

The “boardwalk” is a 2,000-foot long concrete structure that runs along the east shore of the Schuylkill from Locust Street to the newly built South Street stairtower. The boardwalk is around 15 feet wide, so it can be a little crowded, so the city has provided 4 widened areas to relax and enjoy the views. This new extension of the trail is believed to be a transformative experience. You will be able to actually get off of land and be surrounded by the water. It is a truly freeing experience. Being out over the water gives you a very zen feel. The trail has gotten great reviews thus far, but you’ll have to get out there to experience it yourself!

This trail is very near and dear to my heart. It is yet another space for relaxation and collection of thoughts away from the hassle of the city. Running along this trail will simply make you smile. Between the beautiful scenery and the peaceful atmosphere, you will be coming back for more. It is a truly excellent trail and I recommend everyone living in the Philly area make a visit here as soon as possible. You will not regret it!

All ages are welcomed to the trail, where you will see everyone from hardcore (pretentious) cyclists to the amateur (out of shape) joggers. People on the trail are mostly nice and courteous. Taking a stroll along this trail will give you the time we all need to ponder our thoughts and find ourselves again. I am a firm believer in natural mental healing. The Schuylkill River Trail is one of my favorite things in Philadelphia and it just might become yours too.
